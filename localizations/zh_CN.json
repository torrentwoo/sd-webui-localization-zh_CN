    "How fast should training go. Low values will take longer to train, high values may fail to converge (not generate accurate results) and/or may break the embedding (This has happened if you see Loss: nan in the training info textbox. If this happens, you need to manually restore your embedding from an older not-broken backup).\n\nYou can set a single numeric value, or multiple learning rates using the syntax:\n\n   rate_1:max_steps_1, rate_2:max_steps_2, ...\n\nEG:   0.005:100, 1e-3:1000, 1e-5\n\nWill train with rate of 0.005 for first 100 steps, then 1e-3 until 1000 steps, then 1e-5 for all remaining steps.": "训练应该进行多快。低值将需要更长的时间来训练，高值可能无法收敛（无法生成准确的结果）和/或可能会破坏嵌入（如果您在训练信息文本框中看到 Loss: nan ，就会发生这种情况。如果发生这种情况，您需要 从较旧的未损坏备份中手动恢复嵌入）。\n\n您可以使用以下语法设置单个数值或多个学习率：\n\n    “rate_1：max_steps_1，rate_2：max_steps_2，...”\n\n例如：0.005:100、1e-3:1000、1e-5\n\n前 100 步将以 0.005 的速率进行训练，然后以 1e-3 直至 1000 步进行训练，然后以 1e-5 的速率训练所有剩余的步骤。",
